# MatchingApp Code Fixing Instructions

## Introduction

Welcome to the MatchingApp project! Your task is to go through the project files and locate specific areas of the code marked with `// YOUR CODE HERE`. These are the places where you need to implement or fix the code to ensure the application functions correctly.

## Steps to Follow

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone the project from the GitHub repository using the following command:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/riadasllani/life2-phase3.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd life2-phase3
     ```

2. **Create Your Own Branch**:
   - Based on the master branch, create a new branch named with your full name, using hyphens instead of spaces (e.g., "jusuf-thaci"):
     ```bash
     git checkout -b your-name
     ```

3. **Open the Project in Visual Studio**:
   - Open Visual Studio.
   - Use the `File -> Open -> Project/Solution` menu to open the `MatchingApp.sln` solution file located in the root directory of the project.

4. **Search for `// YOUR CODE HERE`**:
   - Use the search functionality in Visual Studio (Ctrl + Shift + F) to search for the comment `// YOUR CODE HERE`.
   - This will show you all the places in the code where you need to make modifications.

5. **Implement the Code**:
   - Carefully review each location where the comment `// YOUR CODE HERE` is found.
   - Write the necessary code to fix or complete the implementation. Make sure your code adheres to best practices and passes all necessary checks.
   - Test your changes to ensure they work as expected.

6. **Testing**:
   - Build the solution and run the application to verify that your changes are correct.
   - Ensure that there are no build errors or runtime exceptions.
   - Test the functionality of the app to make sure everything works as intended.

7. **Submit Your Changes**:
   - Once you have completed and tested all the code fixes, push your changes to your GitHub repository on the newly created branch:
     ```bash
     git push origin your-name
     ```
   - Share the link to your branch with your instructor for evaluation.
